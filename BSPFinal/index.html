    <h2 id="MapLocationName">Bethlehem Steel Plant</h2>
    <p id="MapLocationDesc">    The Bethlehem Steel Plant was Buffalo's biggest producer of steel from 1903 until its shutdown in late 1983. The plant was formerly known as Lackawanna Steel, until it became a subsidiary of Bethlehem Steel in 1922, which marked Bethlehem becoming the second largest steel company in the world.
    This site attempts to illustrate the character, growth, change, and history of the site by utilizing two key modes, and five different layers. The first mode is a structured narrative for the user to follow and learn more about the site, while the alternative lets the user freely move around and explore the site.
    The five major layers are indicative of major points in the steel plant's history. They include its initial construction layout in 1903, the plants formal integration with Bethlehem and its rapid development between 1924 and 1930, the extent of the industrial powerhouse shortly before the plant's shutdown in 1984, and finally, the remnants still left on the contamintated site today in 2021.

This was one of three parts on a project regarding the industrial histories of Buffalo's Outer Harbor Region and the lack of modern representation, and was worked on by myself (Dustin Klinger), Brian Nicpon, and Michael Vigliotti. \n     To keep this a constantly developing project, or temporal apparatus as we like to call it, we really could use your help. If we got something wrong about Bethlehem's history, or you think you have something worth adding, I would love to hear from you. If you have any advice on coding or website optimization in general, we would also love to hear back (I'm an architect, not a programmer, so this was extraordinarily difficult for me). Or, if you want to just send us your general thoughts or concerns, or even a question or two, please feel free. You can email me at dmklinge@buffalo.edu. Thanks again so much for stopping by!";
